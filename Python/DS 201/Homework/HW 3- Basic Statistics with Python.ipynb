    "A distribution (here it is one of the numerical column) in which the values of mean, median and mode coincide (i.e. mean = median = mode) is known as a symmetrical distribution (a perfect data set). Conversely, when values of mean, median and mode are not equal the distribution is known as asymmetrical or skewed distribution. In moderately skewed or asymmetrical distribution a very important relationship exists among these three measures of central tendency. In such distributions the distance between the mean and median is about one-third of the distance between the mean and mode. Karl Pearson, a reknowned statistician, expressed this relationship as:\n",
